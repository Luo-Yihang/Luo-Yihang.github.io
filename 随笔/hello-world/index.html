        <p>This blog is an English translation of my first blog, <a href="https://darklyh.com/%E9%9A%8F%E7%AC%94/%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD%EF%BC%8C%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C/">“你好，世界”</a> (which translates to “Hello, World”). I’ve translated this blog for English-speaking readers in the hopes that it will provide insight into why this personal website exists. In the future, I may also create more English content here.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>I plan to write a blog.</p>
<p>It’s not like I haven’t written one before. Two years ago, on a lonely night, I created my first blog. Back then, I used WordPress, with its rich preset themes and a glamorous drag-and-drop UI design, which made blogging feel like playing with LEGO. However, the content was sparse and hastily put together. I seemed to have only uploaded some photos that I thought were well taken. Looking back now, I feel restless when I recall how I promoted that flashy but shallow blog to people around me.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, I decided to write something substantial, so I migrated my blog to Hexo. While Hexo also had preset themes, at least it involved working with code, which felt more fitting for a programmer’s blog. At that time, I wrote most of my articles in English because I was living in an English-speaking country, and I thought writing in English added a touch of glamour. Most of the articles didn’t have much content, but during the blog’s heyday, it would receive over a hundred daily visits. At that time, my pitiable English skills and restless spirit left me feeling self-satisfied even after producing those meager articles.</p>
<p>One day, when I tried to search for technical solutions in Chinese, I found that the search results were all the same. Everyone seemed to be copying existing answers and pasting them into their blogs or responses. Seeking answers in Chinese on the internet felt like rummaging through a garbage bin for food. Of course, there was food to be found, but gradually losing patience often left me satisfied with leftovers. Some people even asked, why not search directly in English? After all, English answers were often of higher quality. Some went further, taking pride in seeking knowledge only in English, mocking users who typed in Chinese into search engines with a sarcastic smile. This kind of arrogance made me feel truly sad.</p>
<p>I realized that it was time for me to write something meaningful. Not only did I need to write, but I also needed to write in Chinese.</p>
<p>So, what to write about?</p>
<p>Let’s start with technology. I will share my knowledge of computer science. Many people share knowledge, and many do it in Chinese, but the effort often appears scattered. Good sharing should not be about taking notes for oneself but about keeping the readers in mind. It should not only be understandable but also applause-worthy. In the current environment where Chinese technical sharing is less than satisfying, one person’s contribution may seem feeble, but if no one is willing to do it, even the sighs of the few who do try will be precious.</p>
<p>Essays will also appear on my blog. I will write some articles that convey my emotions. As I write this article, I have recently stepped into adulthood. Every individual has emotions and thoughts, and I am no exception. Living life, experiencing ups and downs, deepens one’s understanding of the world. But thoughts seem to scatter like dust when spoken, and writing them down feels more grounded. If I were to post them on social media, they would disappear into the ground in the moment when people scroll through their phones. So, I’ll use this blog to house my restless soul. However, these essays I write can be casually read by readers, serving as post-meal conversation for well-intentioned idlers or as the seed of “gossip” for those with malicious intentions.</p>
<p>I named my blog ‘Dark Hole,’ which is synonymous with ‘Black Hole.’ As for why I chose ‘Dark’ over ‘Black,’ it’s purely because I like the word ‘Dark.’ So, you can also see that the domain name of this blog is darklyh.com, where ‘lyh’ is an abbreviation of my name.</p>
<p>Finally, the title of the blog is “你好，世界”, which means exactly “Hello, World”. So, welcome to my blog!</p>
